For this project, I decided to get some hands-on practice with using an K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning model. 
I realize that it is possible that I did make errors and that some of my processes and interpretations may be incorrect.
This is where feedback would be appreciated enabling me to learn from my mistakes. The datasets used in this project are fictional. 
I wanted to do try something different and not use datasets that are used frequently. For future projects involving practice, I will 
use realistic datasets to further my understanding of this machine learning algorithm. I wanted to keep this project fun and reflect on 
my days as a personal trainer which were not exceedingly long lived.
